# Beer Consumption

### Project description and motivation

As a huge beer lover I always wondered which factors matter the most while the tiny red blink in peoples' head  turn on: "I feel like drinking beer!".<br>
Finding an appropriate dataset with many factors listed isn't an easy task - that's definitely one of my future projects - to scrap, collect or just simply interview people and create my own dataset that will enable me getting to know my neighbourhood better.<br>
Back to the current project - If you were ever asking yourself what makes people drinking beer, you can definitely find few interesting investigations in my notebook. That's the simple regression problem treated with more advanced ensemble techniques - Stacking and Blending. Having few basic features, the model is predicting the beer consumption that may occur. At the end I "packed" all of that in a simple and eye-catching user interface that can be run in your browser.

### Data description

The dataset I used was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/dongeorge/beer-consumption-sao-paulo.<br>
It was collected in Sao Paulo, Brazil in university area. The respondents were between 18 and 28 years old.<br>
The dataset is described in portuguese, nevertheless it's very explicit and easy to understand, at the beginning of my work with the data and translated it into English.

### EDA, Model implementation and taken steps

A detailed explanation what steps I've taken throughout the project is included within the jupyter notebook.
